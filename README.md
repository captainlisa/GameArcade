# Game Arcade

## Concept:

My project is a small game arcade. I wanted try programming little games and create a gaming environment including a user login and options for customization.
The basic idea is that there is a menu that leads the user to the actual arcade and to the login. When entering the arcade, the user can choose which game
they would like to play. The login page gives the option for users to register with an account, store their previous points and highscores and show a scoreboard with the 
scores of all the different registered users.

## User Stories:

- As a new user I want to register and create an account to save my score.
- As a player I want to have access to the scoreboard, to compare my score with other users.
- As a player I want to navigate through the menu, to choose between the login, options and games.
- As a player in Snake I want to control my snake, to navigate it across the field.
- As a player in Snake I want to be able to eat fruits with the snake, to gain points.
- As a player in memory, I want to be able to turn two cards, in order to see if they are the same.

## Milestones (Requirements):

- 10.: ERD is done (pen & paper)
- 13.: the login and registration are done and a user can login via the UI (java + database connection, MySQL for database plus javafx)
- 17.: Snake game (+ UI) is finished and playable (java + javafx)
- 18.: the scoreboard is done incl UI (java + javafx + MySQL to save game score)
- 19.: finishing touches
- 20.: the presentation is done

## Functions to implement in the future:
- the options menu on the main screen of the game
- option to customize a player avatar (because people LOVE customizing stuff!)
- option to customize the layout, different colour schemes
- add different levels for the games (e.g. Snake with obstacles and faster speed)
- add more games like memory, tetris and space invaders
- add graphics to background and game elements
